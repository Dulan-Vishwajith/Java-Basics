# Movie Matcher



A Java console-based application that compares movie details with a user's viewing preferences to determine compatibility. Users can input movie information (name, release year, language, genre) and specify their preferred movie criteria (year range, language, genre). The program then validates whether the movie matches the userâ€™s preferences.



## Features



\* Accepts movie details and user preferences as input

\* Compares movie attributes against preferred criteria

\* Displays both movie details and user preferences

\* Provides match validation feedback

\* Structured with multiple classes for clean modular design



## Concepts Used



\* Java `Scanner` class for user input

\* Object-oriented programming (classes and objects)

\* Data encapsulation through getters and setters

\* Conditional validation and logical comparison

\* Array handling and string manipulation



## Tools \& Technologies



\* Language: Java SE

\* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code

\* Packages: `entity` (for structured class organization)



## Goal



To practice \*\*object-oriented programming\*\* and class interaction concepts by implementing a simple yet practical console application.
